Hey!

You're receiving this email because I haven't heard if you're coming to our wedding and, well, we're running out of time.

Last call kiddies. Please get back to me in the next couple of days; after that, you're still welcome to crash, but plan on bringing a chair and your fast-food of choice. (And please order me a few extra if you're getting Dick's.)

Note this is YOUR personal link (tied to your RSVP response and any +1s you specify).

Questions or whatever, hit me: 502-807-1976
