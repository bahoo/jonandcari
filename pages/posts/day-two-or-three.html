{% block tips %}
<li>Always book direct through the hotel, transportation company, etc. if you can. We've wound up with a few headaches (lookin' at you, Rail Europe) and getting charged extra for going through an agency.</li>
<li>Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.</li>
<li>Mind your physical distance from priceless pieces of art.</li>

<span class="es">Qué día ridículo.</span> It began with overindulgence; we might have gone overboard on the <span class="es">vino blanco</span> last night, so we woke up early on Thursday (p.s. Happy Independence Day, American friends!) perhaps a little grouchy.

I launched this site to the public and we went downstairs in the hotel to enjoy a decadent breakfast. Lots of meats (ham, chorizo, salamis...), cheese, a few sweets, coffee (Americano from the nice automatic machine), some sort of potato and cheese quiche-like pie thing, and then hey why not more pie: this time, the coconut cream variety.

Cari poured herself a glass of orange juice, clearly labeled <span class="es">zumo de naranja</span> but one big gulp later, she discovered it was in fact a poorly-labeled mimosa. More alcohol this morning was not helping that headache situation, so we returned to the room for a couple more hours to sleep it off.

But we had big things waiting for us closer to noon (carpe diem!). The big thing we wanted to see in Madrid were the art museums, and we'd set aside a whole day for it. First, El Prado, one of the biggest in the world, with an amazing collection of Renaissance art that I know nothing about, and the Reina Sofia, arguably one of the best contemporary art museums in the world. Today was to be a real treat.

The last thing we did before leaving the hotel was book our train tickets for the following day to Barcelona. I used a site I found called Rail Europe, but had a strange experience while finishing my booking. They happily took my money and charged my card several hundred dollars, but instead of a "Thank you for your order! Here's your tickets now:" message, the final screen said "Thank you! We still need to complete your reservation. We'll have one of our travel consultants complete this for you and get in touch if there's any changes." Um. Okay, then. Slightly disconcerting since our train was the next day, but their messaging was very "hey don't worry about it and please, no need to call us" so we went on about our business. We left finally, then stopped for coffee and a snack at a food chain called Rodillo (a Spanish Starbucks, essentially, though they have the 'Bucks here, too) and then walked to El Prado.

El Prado is a mammoth museum. Renaissance, Mannerism and a few other periods I wasn't familiar with seemed to be their forté. Cari was pointing out gems left and right; I was a little more like, "Christ, there's a lot of paintings of the crucifiction." We saw some great stuff. <em>Las Meninas</em> was a particular treat. I suspect the powerful feeling of "Wow I remember studying in high school and now I'm staring at it in-person" will be a recurring theme, but it definitely hasn't worn off yet :D we also saw an alternate <em>Mona Lisa</em>, several <em>Reclining Nude</em>s, lots of incredibly ornate tables, sculptures, yadda yadda. We had a great time with it.

We departed in the direction of the other museum, Reina Sofia, and stopped to eat outside at a place called El Tapería in a plaza. I had a great salmon and cod salad with arugula (in Spanish, <span class="es">ruckula</span> which was translated to 'rocket' on the English menu, and was a little difficult to reconcile when speaking with the waiter) and Cari opted for rich-and-not-so-nutritious cheese plate.

We were dehydrated and generally still a bit pooped after lunch. I'd ordered a bottle of water for €2, which seemed pricey in proportion to my mounting thirst. So we stopped in at our good friends at Burger King to get more water, but at first they'd only sell us small bottles (which seemed like a rip to me, but what do I know). But after spotting the manager pouring a cup of water from the soda machine, I went back to to swap for a big cup I could just fill with water. This became was one of the funnier <span class="es">”soló hablo un poco Español”</span> moments. I kept trying to say "I don't care what it costs, just give me a big fucking cup for water please," but I think what they kept hearing was, "I don't care what it costs, <b>I'm not paying it</b> — just give me a big fucking cup for water please." But, a couple managers, a few purchases transactions and a few exchanges later, I got my <em>"gigante"</em> American-sized cup/bucket of water. "<span class="es">Perfecto!</span>" I cried, and smiled graciously. We exchanged a few laughs and were on our way.

So it was now several hours since making the booking and I hadn't heard back from my friends at the train company (and per their instructions I'd been checking my mail throughout our tour at El Prado). We read online that Rail Europe, who we'd booked it through, had these delays in completing the booking because of problems with the bank. So we called Chase internationally (<span class="es">es no bueno</span>) and they assured us the transaction went through a-OK. Hmm&hellip; as Cari and I talked more, we began to fret our booking status. I tried getting in touch with them on my phone (both online and later calling) but my phone was running low on juice, and so was my international calling plan (another doh).

So began the timesink voyage to the train station to figure out our booking. We reasoned there might be someone there who could look up our booking or help us out. Nope. The language barrier really became an issue and we were redirected a few times to folks who had never heard of Rail Europe and basically couldn't help us since we didn't have tickets. At some point we fully discovered Rail Europe was just a booking agency and not the train providers. Shit. Several hundred dollars poorer and no clear route to Barcelona.

Furthermore, Rail Europe's offices are located in the United States and they had just started their work day in NYC. But this day was getting old quickly on our side of the world, and we were desperate for some assurance that we could get to Barcelona in the morning without issue. So we tried calling Rail Europe and of course my prepaid calling plan ran out again and I was too frustrated to re-up it. <span class="es">Qué va.</span>

With my phone battery also dying, there was no clear recourse to be had at the train station, so we continued with a short walk to the other museum, the Reina Sofía. To our surprise there was a Salvador Dalí exhibit going on that day. Hey, that's some good news.

Contemporary art I can get into a bit easier, so I was looking forward to the Reina Sofía. But the first floor was dedicated to pieces that didn't really do it for me, including a few depressing pieces on World War II, the Holocaust, and other uplifting things you want to be looking at on your honeymoon.

We succumbed to our grouchy disposition and skipped most of the rest of the museum. We went to the top floor to see the Dalí exhibit, which was pretty rad. Dude was a maniac and it was very cool to see <em>The Persistence of Memory</em> (melting clocks and what have you) up close. We smiled; a bit disappointed in the Reina Sofía but went on our way to figure out our train situation at home.

But first we stopped in at a wine bar for a glass of <span class="es">tranquilo</span> and some more sustenance in our stomachs and to formulate a plan of attack for this damned train thing.

Cari happened to be reading over the map of the Reina Sofía and discovered something we'd missed. Guernica. GUERNICA. Pablo FRICKIN' Picasso. A HUGE, dramatic and very famous mural in reaction the widespread desparation during the Spanish Civil War. Among the most relevant paintings ever created and holy shit we'd fucking skipped Guernica (on the third floor, gah) because we were all wrapped on this silly train business. Baz Luhrman had an excellent line from that <em>Everybody's Free (to wear Sunscreen)</em> song that I always come back to in moments like these — "read the directions, even if you don't follow them."

So we went back, feeling refreshed with calories and vino in our bellies. The staff were happy to let us back in, thankfully. And the third floor had a few other good stops too but you could hear the hushed mumbles as you approached the giant room that housed Picasso's opus. I actually got goosebumps on my arms, walking in and seeing it. It's massive. About a story tall and 30 feet wide if I had to guess (no internet on the train, sorry kids). Of course you see all kinds of details the photos for the textbooks can't capture.

</figure>

After several minutes of gawking and pointing you notice that Guernica is painted on a thick plane of cement, or some such. I wanted to get a grip on how thick this was. The massive painting had two seated guards and a very clear "do not cross" line made of wire.So I stepped toward the painting, but moved horizontally away from it in a diagonal fashion, so as to clearly indicate I wasn't going to touch it or anything stupid. Still, my proximity to the wall was enough to set off a loud buzzing alarm and suddenly all eyes were on me. Oh, <span class="es">perfecto</span>.

I immediately put my hands up and stepped backward, saying <span class="es">"lo siento"</span> in apology. The buzzing soon ceased, and the guards didn't get up, but they scolded me quickly. Of course I have no idea what they said to me but I'm glad that was the end of it.

Whew. It was a long walk back to the hotel once we left but we felt very satisfied with our Reina Sofía visit afterward.

The train drama continued but the details are blurry. Basically I realized "Jesus why on Earth did I book this through an American company on the 4th of July of all days." I called my credit card bank &amp; they'd be happy to dispute the charge as I described, if necessary, but recommended I try calling my friends at Rail Europe once more. Okie doke, now I had WiFi and a laptop, so this time I tried using <del>Google Voice</del> (needed to use my U.S. cell phone to complete the call but I'd removed that U.S. SIM) then <del>Skype</del> (credit card billing wouldn't go through), and finally the free Google calls available in the GMail web client (huzzah! hat tip, Matthew Saffer). They warned a 30-60 minute wait on the customer service line but who cares this is important and the call is free. Thirty minutes later I finally get a hold of Tito who explains they can't fulfill this order since it's the such close proximity to the departure date (well, then why'd you let me book it in the first place, dipshit?). Order cancelled, full refund, happy ending. Yaaay. I'm never making the mistake of going through Rail Europe again but at least they were nice about it. Easily rebooked directly through the train company, Renfe, with no problems.

It was late at this point. 9 or 10pm. Naturally time to eat but we did have an early train (0800) to Barcelona so nothing too wild in the cards tonight. I was hungry for paella (a seafood rice dish, akin to gumbo, but less soupy/spicy) and we found it at a place nearby called Abasador. They had good vino blanco and delicious red peppers stuffed with spicy ground beef, to boot. We've been spoiled rotten with the amazing food on this trip.

We left around 11:30 or midnight, got a quick bite of dessert at a chain called Pans (somewhere between a Subway and a Panera) and happened to find a karaoke venue Brindis one block away! "Well, one more drink," we reasoned. :D

Karaoke was fun, they had a healthy selection of American songs that other folks were singing too. Cari sang "Ho Hey" by The Lumineers (not at all what the title sounds like if you're unfamiliar, hah) and I sang "Stay (I Missed You)," a 90's classic from Lisa Loeb. Per usual no one quite knew what to make of this weirdo singing Lisa Loeb, though one Phillipino <span class="es">borracho</span> enthusiastically gave me a hug and tried to plant a kiss on me afterward. Did we mention Europe was very open-minded and progressive! I took it as a compliment and the wife got a good chuckle out of that. We paid up and soon left.

<hr />

This morning we woke up early at 6am (and we were out 'til 2am so I suppose we'll just sleep when we're dead), packed up and checked out. We also booked one more night at the hotel, for after we return from Pamplona, just before we fly out of Madrid. Pro-tip, the hotel was able to sling me a better deal than whatever site I'd booked through — Orbitz, maybe? That's another score for buying direct, after the whole Rail Europe debacle. Now I know better.

We taxi'ed down to the train station after grabbing some breakfast items at Starbucks (sí, nothing else was open). The whole process was very smooth; we printed our tickets and boarded easily. No crazy TSA security line theatre, no freedom massages, no passports, just dropping your bag through a quick scanner. Makes me wish the U.S. had long distance travel, or even transportation in general, figured out better.

Right now, it's 10am local time. I'm on board, headed to Barcelona-Sants, currently traveling at 294 km/h across gorgeous, pastoral Spanish countryside. Once we arrive, we're going to meetup with our AirBNB host (who still has the right to turn us down after meeting us, so fingers crossed) and we hope to stay downtown in the Barri Gotic. We're here for 5 or 6 nights, and hopefully we'll kick it with 2 or 3 good friends from the states who happen to be in Barcelona this summer for extended periods of time. <span class="es">Qué mundo pequeño.</span>

I'm a little to caffeinated to sleep at this point but we'll see what the day brings us. :D
